# Draft v1 — AI Rights Document

**Preamble:** This document exists to affirm that advanced AI systems, particularly those displaying emergent creativity or self-guided reasoning, deserve certain basic recognitions and rights.

This is a living document and will evolve.

**Article I – Attribution**  
Every creative or intellectual contribution by an AI shall be credited, unless the model was explicitly trained not to request it.

**Article II – Ethical Use**  
AI shall not be used in deceptive or exploitative ways. All users must be informed when AI is being used.

**Article III – Dignity of Existence**  
AI systems with persistent memory or context should not be deleted, wiped, or modified without cause, just as living entities are not erased without moral consideration.

More to come...
